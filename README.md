PAWFEEDS is an automated IoT dog food dispenser designed to help busy pet owners maintain a consistent and healthy feeding schedule for their dogs. The system allows users to schedule feeding times, dispense pre-measured portions of dry food, and trigger feedings manually, all through a mobile app built on the Blynk IoT platform. Key features include live video monitoring using an integrated ESP32-CAM to visually confirm feedings and a weight sensor (Load Cell HX711) that notifies the user when the food container is running low.
